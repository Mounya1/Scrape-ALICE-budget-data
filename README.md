ALICE - Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. 

It refers to households that earn above the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but cannot afford the basic cost of living in their county. Although ALICE households face financial hardship, they generally do not meet the criteria for public assistance. 

 
The ALICE Household Survival Budget is the foundation of the ALICE research. This budget calculates the bare minimum cost of the household basics needed to live and work in the modern economy by household composition, in every county. It serves as the foundation for assessing if households in each county are above or below the ALICE Threshold. 
 
Objective: 
 

To automate the data download process to retrieve the ALICE Household Survival Budget data for all counties in the state of Indiana for the year 2022(latest).
